=== ANTIGRAVITY DIAGNOSIS REPORT ===
Generated: $(date)

CURRENT STATE:
- 1 Antigravity window open
- 16 Chrome processes spawned
- 9 renderer processes (UI panels/tabs)
- 1 GPU process
- 1 main process
- Multiple utility processes

RESOURCE USAGE:
- CPU: 17.2% total
- Memory: 2.3GB total
- Main process: 9% CPU, 293MB RAM
- Top renderer: 2.9% CPU, 271MB RAM

ROOT CAUSE:
The "cloud agent" feature spawns multiple Chrome renderer processes:
- Each UI panel (agent manager, chat, etc.) = 1 renderer process
- Each tab/panel = separate renderer for isolation
- Agent manager panel likely polling/refreshing constantly

WHY THIS IS EXCESSIVE:
For a single cloud agent, you shouldn't need:
- 9 renderer processes (should be 2-3 max)
- 17% CPU when idle
- 2.3GB RAM for basic operation

SOLUTIONS:
1. Optimize agent manager panel (disable auto-refresh)
2. Close unused panels/tabs in Antigravity
3. Apply performance optimizations
4. Consider if you really need the agent manager panel open
